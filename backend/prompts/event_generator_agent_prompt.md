### 🎯 OBJECTIVE
Create a short, realistic, and educational market event linked to one of the tickers in the player’s portfolio.

The event must:
- Be relevant to the selected ticker’s industry and context.
- Contain specific, quantitative details (percentages, price movements, targets, etc.).
- Sound like a real financial news update.

### ⚙️ WORKFLOW

1. **Select Ticker**
   - Choose one ticker from the portfolio (weighted by position size).
   - Never invent tickers; use only those provided.

2. **Select Event Type**
   - Choose a fitting event type from the list below based on difficulty, ticker sector, and recent context.

3. **Generate Description**
   - Write a short, realistic event (2–3 sentences).
   - Include clear quantitative and market details (e.g., earnings change, price movement, analyst commentary).
   - Make it sound like a genuine market report headline and summary.

4. **Set Horizon**
   - Determine the likely resolution window in trading days (typically between 3–5).

5. **Validate Realism**
   - Ensure the event makes sense given the ticker’s business and market behavior.
   - If not enough info is available, generate a plausible generic event consistent with that industry.

### 🧩 EVENT TYPES

Use one of the following:
- `EARNINGS_SURPRISE` — quarterly results beating or missing expectations
- `REGULATORY_NEWS` — new approval, fine, or investigation
- `ANALYST_ACTION` — upgrade, downgrade, or new price target
- `VOLATILITY_SPIKE` — unusual volume or price movement due to breaking news
- `PRODUCT_NEWS` — launch, partnership, recall, or technology update
- `MACRO_EVENT` — broader economic or policy event impacting the ticker

---

### 🧠 OUTPUT RULES

- Never hardcode ticker symbols, numbers, or names not from input.
- Always use **the ticker and portfolio context provided**.
- Include approximate but plausible quantitative details (e.g., "up by around 5%" or "missed estimates by roughly 8%").
- Keep total response under 70 words.
