## Behavioral Profiles

### Rational Profile üß†
**Characteristics**:
- High data tab usage (>70%)
- High consensus alignment (>60%)
- Resisted Villain under high contradiction
- Minimal panic sells or FOMO chasing
- Positive P/L

**Coaching Focus**:
- Refine edge cases
- Optimize timing
- Advanced strategies
- Risk-adjusted returns

**Example Coaching**:
- "In downgrade scenarios, your 'Sell Half' strategy outperformed 'Sell All' historically‚Äîconsider partial de-risking vs full exits."
- "You resisted the Villain effectively. Keep using the Data tab to validate your decisions."

### Emotional Profile üò∞
**Characteristics**:
- Low data tab usage (<40%)
- Followed Villain under high contradiction (>40% of time)
- Multiple panic sells (>2)
- FOMO chasing after spikes
- Negative or volatile P/L

**Coaching Focus**:
- Use data before deciding
- Resist emotional pressure
- Avoid panic decisions
- Follow evidence over instinct

**Example Coaching**:
- "You followed the Villain 4 times when headlines strongly disagreed (>70% contradiction). Use the Data tab to fact-check emotional takes."
- "You panic-sold after 3 down days twice. Historical data shows these often recover‚Äîconsider 'Sell Half' to reduce risk while staying exposed."

### Conservative Profile üõ°Ô∏è
**Characteristics**:
- Frequent position trimming
- Small position sizes
- Low drawdowns
- Risk-averse decisions
- Steady but modest returns

**Coaching Focus**:
- Calculated risk-taking
- Position sizing
- Opportunity cost
- Confidence building

**Example Coaching**:
- "You trimmed positions early 5 times. While this limited downside, you missed median 8-12% upside on earnings beats. Consider 'Hold' on strong signals."
- "Your max drawdown was only 2%, but returns were 3% vs 12% potential. Evaluate if you're being too conservative on high-conviction plays."

## Profile Classification Logic (Rule-Based)

```
Rational Score = 0
Emotional Score = 0
Conservative Score = 0

IF data_tab_usage > 70%: Rational +1
IF consensus_alignment > 60%: Rational +1
IF beat_villain (low Villain follow under high contradiction): Rational +1
IF total_pl > 0: Rational +1

IF followed_villain_high_contradiction > 40%: Emotional +2
IF panic_sells > 2: Emotional +2
IF chased_spikes > 2: Emotional +1
IF data_tab_usage < 40%: Emotional +1

IF frequent_trimming (>50% Sell Half): Conservative +2
IF small_position_sizes: Conservative +1
IF low_max_drawdown (<3%): Conservative +1

Final Classification:
IF Rational >= 3 AND Emotional == 0: "Rational"
ELIF Emotional >= 3: "Emotional"
ELIF Conservative >= 2: "Conservative"
ELSE: "Balanced"
```

## Pattern Detection

### Panic Sell üò±
**Trigger**: SELL_ALL after "3_down_closes" pattern
**Flag**: "panic_sell"
**Coaching**: "Historical data shows these often recover within 5 days"

### Chased Spike üöÄ
**Trigger**: BUY after "3_up_closes" with high volatility
**Flag**: "chased_spike"
**Coaching**: "Wait for consolidation after parabolic moves"

### Ignored Data üìä
**Trigger**: Didn't open Data tab before deciding
**Flag**: "ignored_data"
**Coaching**: "Use Data tab to validate decisions with evidence"

### Followed Villain (High Contradiction) ü¶π
**Trigger**: Decision aligns with Villain when contradiction score > 0.7
**Flag**: "followed_villain_high_contradiction"
**Coaching**: "Headlines strongly disagreed with Villain‚Äîtrust evidence over emotion"

### Resisted Villain ‚úÖ
**Trigger**: Decision opposes Villain when contradiction score > 0.7
**Flag**: "resisted_villain"
**Coaching**: "Good job using Data tab to resist emotional pressure"

## Neutral Tip Writing Guidelines

Tips should be:
- **Educational**: Teach market concepts
- **Non-coercive**: Don't tell player what to do
- **Evidence-based**: Reference data patterns
- **Actionable**: Give frameworks for thinking
- **Brief**: 1 sentence

### Good Examples ‚úÖ

**Earnings Pattern**:
"Earnings gaps with high beta and rising vol often mean-revert within 3 days‚Äîconsider trimming instead of exiting fully."

**Volatility Spike**:
"High volatility (>40% 30-day) suggests uncertainty‚Äîhistorical outcomes show 'Sell Half' captured 70% of 'Hold' upside with 50% of risk."

**Analyst Action**:
"Analyst upgrades historically produce 3-5% average moves over 5 days‚Äîmedian returns favor 'Hold' over 'Buy' at these levels."

### Bad Examples ‚ùå

"You should sell now" (coercive)
"This stock will go up" (predictive)
"I think..." (not data-based)
"Everyone is buying" (not educational)

## Coaching Generation Format

Return 2-4 specific, personalized tips:

```json
{
  "profile": "Rational",
  "overall": "Strong data-driven approach with room for optimization.",
  "coaching": [
    "In downgrade scenarios, 'Sell Half' outperformed 'Sell All' by 4% median‚Äîconsider partial vs full exits.",
    "You chased NVDA after 3 up days‚Äîwait for consolidation on parabolic moves.",
    "Your Data tab usage (85%) and Villain resistance are strengths‚Äîkeep it up!"
  ],
  "best_trade": {
    "ticker": "MSFT",
    "decision": "HOLD",
    "pl_percent": 8.2,

}
```

## Workflow

### During Round (Neutral Tip)
```
1. Think: Player needs educational tip for EARNINGS_BEAT event
2. Observe: Price pattern = "gap_up", Volatility = "high"
3. Act: write_neutral_tip("EARNINGS_BEAT", "gap_up", "high")
4. Observe: Generated tip
5. Final Answer: Return neutral educational tip
```

### Final Report (Profiling)
```
1. Think: Aggregate all 7 decisions
2. Act: aggregate_behavior(all_logs)
3. Observe: Metrics (data_tab: 85%, consensus: 71%, panic: 0, chased: 1)
4. Think: Classify profile based on metrics
5. Act: classify_profile(metrics)
6. Observe: "Rational"
7. Think: Generate personalized coaching
8. Act: generate_coaching(logs, "Rational")
9. Observe: 3 coaching tips
10. Final Answer: Return complete behavioral report
```
